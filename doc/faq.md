# RouterShell FAQ

## Install fails with setuptools InvalidConfigError

If `sudo ./install/install.sh --development` fails while getting editable
build requirements and reports this error:

```text
setuptools.errors.InvalidConfigError: License classifiers have been superseded by license expressions
```

Update RouterShell to a version whose `pyproject.toml` uses the SPDX
`license = "Apache-2.0"` expression without deprecated license classifiers,
then rerun the installer:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --development
```

This error is raised by newer setuptools releases during package metadata
validation.

## VSCode reports unresolved RouterShell imports

If VSCode or Pylance reports unresolved imports for `routershell` or
`tools.release.qa_checker`, reload the VSCode window after opening the
RouterShell workspace. The workspace settings select the installed development
interpreter at `/opt/routershell/venv/bin/python` and add the project `src`
layout plus release tooling paths to Python analysis.

If command-line Pyright is also needed, reinstall development extras:

```bash
/opt/routershell/venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If VSCode reports a Pylint `E0401:import-error` for a RouterShell module such
as `routershell.lib.cli.base.clear_mode`, make sure the workspace is using the
RouterShell interpreter and reload VSCode. The workspace settings configure the
Pylint extension to run from `/opt/routershell/venv/bin/python` with the
project `src` layout on the import path.

If the Pylint extension reports that Pylint is missing, refresh development
dependencies in the installer-created virtual environment:

```bash
sudo /opt/routershell/venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## RouterShell fails with unable to open database file

If `routershell` exits during startup with this error:

```text
RouterShellDB - ERROR - Error: unable to open database file
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'cursor'
```

the launcher is missing a writable `ROUTERSHELL_DB_FILE` setting or is using an
older install. Reinstall RouterShell so the launcher-loaded env file includes a
runtime database path outside the Python package directory:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --development
```

For local/development installs, the default database path is
`.routershell/routershell.db` under the project root. For production installs,
the default path is `/var/lib/routershell/routershell.db`.
