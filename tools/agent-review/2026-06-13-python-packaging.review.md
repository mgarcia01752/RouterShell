### Summary
Added modern Python packaging metadata for RouterShell, including console entry points, runtime and development dependencies, package-data declarations, version metadata, and local development documentation. Added a compatibility launcher and smoke tests so the existing legacy import layout can be packaged before a larger source-tree refactor.

### Modified Files
- AGENTS.md
- CODING_AGENT.md
- README.md
- lib/__init__.py
- pyproject.toml
- routershell.py
- routershell_version.py
- tests/test_packaging.py

### Commands Executed And Results
- `python3 - <<'PY' ... tomllib.load(...) ... PY` → pass; `pyproject.toml` parsed and expected console scripts were present.
- `python3 -m py_compile routershell.py lib/__init__.py` → pass.
- `python3 tools/release/check_version.py` → pass; version files match at 0.1.0.
- `python3 tools/release/test-runner.py` → pass; packaging smoke tests passed through the release test runner.
- `bash -c 'source tools/git/git-common.sh; rs_run_quality_gates'` → pass; available checks passed.
- `python3 -m build` → fail/blocker; `/usr/bin/python3: No module named build`.
- `python3 -m pytest` → fail/blocker; `/usr/bin/python3: No module named pytest`.
- `python3 -m ruff check .` → fail/blocker; `/usr/bin/python3: No module named ruff`.
- `find . -name '__pycache__' -type d -prune -exec rm -rf {} +` → pass; removed generated validation caches.

### Tests
- `pytest` → not executed because pytest is not installed in this interpreter.
- `ruff` → not executed because Ruff is not installed in this interpreter.
- Packaging smoke tests → pass via release test runner.
- RouterShell quality gates → pass for available checks.

### Notes / Warnings
- This is a compatibility-first package setup. It preserves the current `lib.*` imports and supports legacy top-level imports by adding the installed `lib/` directory to `sys.path` from `lib/__init__.py`.
- A later source-layout cleanup should move toward one canonical package namespace and remove the compatibility path bridge.
- The current environment lacks `pip`, `build`, `pytest`, `ruff`, setuptools, wheel, and the runtime dependencies, so wheel/sdist creation could not be verified here.

### Remaining TODOs / Follow-Ups
- Create a virtual environment and run `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`, then `python -m build`, `python -m pytest`, and `python -m ruff check .`.
- Refactor imports toward one package namespace after packaging is proven in editable mode.
- Decide whether backup modules under `lib/cli/config-bak/` should remain packaged or be excluded from distributions.

This file provides guidance for coding agents working in this repository.
Keep it short, accurate, and updated when workflows change.

## Agent Permissions

<environment_context>

    <network_access>enabled</network_access>
    <!-- Access is governed by this file and explicit user approval -->
</environment_context>

## Project Basics

- Language: Python (3.10+)
- User shorthand: when Maurice says `RS`, treat it as `RouterShell`.
- This repo is NOT greenfield; extend existing code and patterns.
- Build/test entry points are defined in `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, or `scripts/`.
- Read `README.md` first for setup and usage.
- Type checking is strict; avoid `Any` and generic container types.
- Ruff compliance is required (do not auto-format unless explicitly requested).

## External Consumers (Compatibility Contract)

- PyPNM is the authoritative engine and is consumed by downstream repos (example: PyPNM-CMTS).
- Preserve public API stability unless the user explicitly approves breaking changes.
- Do not embed downstream app concerns into PyPNM (keep PyPNM reusable and transport-agnostic).
- If a change affects downstream repos, call it out explicitly before making it.

## Repo Conventions (PyPNM)

- Persistence is filesystem-based artifacts plus metadata persistence per the DB backend design:
  - Binaries and derived artifacts remain on disk under `.data/` roots.
  - Transaction/group/operation metadata is DB-backed (SQLite or Postgres) per `docs/design/db/`.
- DB backend selection is owned by PyPNM at install time (no runtime “auto switching”).
- SQLite is intended for single-writer deployments (standalone/lab/demo).
- Postgres is recommended for multi-worker / multi-process deployments.

## Documentation

- Docs must follow the existing repo docs layout and conventions.
- Update docs alongside code changes (choose the correct location by inspecting the existing docs tree; do not invent parallel structures).
- Do not modify `mkdocs.yml` or navigation unless explicitly required by the task.
- Markdown must render correctly in both MkDocs and GitHub.
- No emojis in documentation.
- Use generic placeholders:
  - MAC: `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`
  - IP: `192.168.0.100`
- Emojis are allowed only in `install.sh`; they are prohibited everywhere else.
- When adding new terms or acronyms, update `docs/definition/index.md` and keep entries in alphabetical order.
- After completing a task, create a single “agent review” file that concatenates the full contents of all files changed in that task (path and naming should follow existing repo practice).
- Always regenerate the agent review bundle after any subsequent edits so it reflects every changed file.
- When an error is fixed, add or update a FAQ entry with the error and resolution, and add a TODO entry noting the FAQ update requirement.

### Reuse Index

- Agents MUST consult the existing reuse / symbol index under `tools/agent-review/` (if present) before introducing new:
  - types, validators, ID formats, storage conventions, persistence adapters, or config namespaces
- Any deviation requires an explicit gap justification and user approval.

## DB Backend Migration (Locked Decisions)

Agents working on the DB backend refactor MUST follow the locked decisions recorded in the design docs (see `docs/design/db/`):

- PyPNM owns persistence, schema initialization, and DB APIs.
- Install-time backend selection via `install.sh` flags + interactive default to SQLite.
- Postgres secrets via env var overrides (no plaintext requirement in tracked JSON).
- Idempotent schema apply using shipped DDL assets + seeding `UNKNOWN` sysDescr + default artifact store(s).
- SQLite for single-writer; Postgres recommended for multi-worker / multi-process (especially downstream orchestration use).
- Paths stored in DB are portable (app-root relative), resolved at runtime.
- CI validates SQLite (required) and Postgres (service container, recommended as required).
- JSON ledger persistence is deprecated and removed from runtime paths (optional offline migrator only).

## Configuration

- `system.json` is the single source of truth.
- New configuration namespaces must be implemented as Pydantic BaseModels.
- BaseModels must use one-line `Field(..., description="...")`.
- Avoid generic `str` for semantic identifiers or paths in public models and APIs; use an existing semantic type or add a new alias in `src/pypnm/lib/types.py`.
- When working with MAC or inet strings, validate using `MacAddress()` or `Inet()` instead of assuming `str(...)` formatting is valid.
- Request override defaults: missing or null means use `system.json` defaults; blank strings are invalid.

## Timestamp Conventions

- All stored timestamps are epoch seconds.
- Convert to ISO-8601 only at display or external response boundaries.

## Coding Guidelines (Strict)

- No generic container imports (`Dict`, `List`, `Tuple`, `Union`).
  Use built-in types and `|`.
- Avoid `Any` unless unavoidable; isolate and justify its usage.
- Every function argument must be annotated.
- Avoid `None` returns; prefer empty values unless `None` is semantically required.
- Avoid magic numbers; use named constants.
- Prefer `BaseModel` over raw dicts for public/stateful structures (state, configuration, persistence records).
- dicts are allowed only for short-lived internal glue logic.
- Prefer classes with static methods over standalone functions.
- Public methods MUST have detailed docstrings.
- Private methods may have minimal docstrings.
- Avoid method-level debug logs.
- Do not add Ruff ignores (`# noqa`, `# ruff: noqa`). If an ignore is needed, ask for permission first.
- Logging pattern in classes:

  ```python
  self.logger = logging.getLogger(f"{self.__class__.__name__}")
  ```

- Prefer `match/case` over long if/else chains.
- No code should contain 3+ nested loops. 2 nested loops are discouraged unless necessary.
- No one-line if statements (E701).
- Preserve all existing whitespace and alignment.
- Never auto-format or re-align code.
- Do not enforce snake_case; keep existing naming conventions as-is.

## FastAPI Guidelines (PyPNM)

- Router files must be lean:
  - `router.py` contains routing glue only (APIRouter configuration, endpoint registration, HTTP status translation).
  - No business logic in `router.py`. Business logic must live in `service.py` for that route group (same folder) or a shared service module if reused.
- All request/response bodies must be Pydantic BaseModels.
- Prefer POST for payload submission and endpoint contracts (PyPNM default).
  - Allow GET only where already present or clearly appropriate (health, readiness, version, status).
- Reuse shared models under the existing `src/pypnm/api/common/` structure (inspect current tree before adding anything new).
- Do not block request paths with `time.sleep()`.

## Tests (Mandatory)

- Every phase deliverable MUST include pytest coverage for new or changed behavior.
- Do not claim a phase item is complete unless pytest has been added and executed (or a concrete blocker is documented).
- Tests must remain hermetic: no live CMTS/cable modem dependencies.

## Burndown Governance

- Agents MUST consult the current burndown and DB design docs before implementing work.
- Agents MUST NOT update burndown checkmarks unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- Code written does not imply progress accepted.

## Workflow Rules

- When the user says “train”, read code silently until told otherwise.
- Do not assume missing context; ask.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
- Do not print file contents into chat unless the user explicitly requests it; ask first if unsure.
- Always end tasks with an agent review bundle containing the full contents of all files touched in the task.
- Agent review bundles must start with the standard summary template block below (before any `# FILE:` sections).
- When the user says `CAT_FILES`, create a single bundle file containing the full contents of every file touched in the task, each preceded by `# FILE: <path>`, and provide the `cat` command for the bundle.
- Keep a brief summary of user prompts after any request for a commit message and track changes since the most recent commit message request.
- When asked for a commit message, respond with the format below, keep it succinct, and include all changes since the last commit message request.
- Before changing version behavior or release tooling, review `tools/git/`, `tools/release/`, and `tools/support/bump_version.py` to avoid version-control drift.
- `tools/git/git-save.sh` is the normal save-commit path and accepts `--commit-msg "<commit-msg>"`.
- `tools/release/release.py` is the supported flow for committed release version updates, tags, and pushes.

## Commit Message Format

- If the chat request starts with `commit-msg`, use the message as the value for `./tools/git/git-save.sh --commit-msg "<commit-msg>"`.
- First line: one-line summary, maximum 50 characters.
- First line must start with one of: `Feature:`, `Bugfix:`, `Docs:`, `Refactor:`, `Test:`, `Tooling:`, `Release:`.
- Detailed description lines are maximum 72 characters per line.
- Every line after the first must start with `-`.
- When the user asks for a commit message, provide plain text for direct paste into the terminal or UI text box.
- Do not wrap commit message suggestions in quotes, backticks, or code fences unless the user explicitly asks for that format.
- Prefer detailed commit messages that describe the current change set clearly.
- Do not default to a one-line commit message when the change set is broad; provide a title plus concise bullet points.
- Avoid redundant wording and avoid repeating the exact prior commit message suggestion unless the diff is unchanged and the user explicitly asks to reuse it.
- If the user asks for "in a text box", return plain text only.
- If the user asks for "in a markdown text box", return the commit message inside a fenced code block with `text`.

### Agent Review Bundle Summary Template (Standard)

Use this Summary block at the very top of every `*.review.md` bundle (before any `# FILE:` sections).

### Summary
<1–3 sentences describing what changed and why. Keep it factual and phase-scoped.>

### Modified Files
- <absolute or repo-relative path 1>
- <path 2>
- <path N>

### Commands Executed And Results
- `<command 1>` → <result (pass/fail + key output)>
- `<command 2>` → <result>
- `<command N>` → <result>

### Tests
- `pytest` → <pass/fail + notes>
- `ruff` → <pass/fail + notes>
- <other> → <pass/fail + notes>

### Notes / Warnings
- <any relevant warnings, deprecations, expected exclusions, or operational notes>
- <or: None>

### Remaining TODOs / Follow-Ups
- <todo 1>
- <todo 2>
- <or: None>

## Repo Hygiene

- License is GPL-2.0-or-later; keep SPDX headers aligned with `LICENSE`.
- For any modified or newly created file, update the SPDX header year to 2026.
- If a file already has a SPDX year and the year has changed, update it as a range (example: 2025 -> 2025-2026).
- Keep `tools/` organized by category.
- Do not add files directly under `tools/` root.

## Agent Self-Checks

Before responding:

- Re-read this file and `README.md`.
- Confirm pytest coverage exists or is explicitly blocked.
- Confirm pytest and ruff output have no deprecation warnings (treat as failures).
- Confirm changes align to the current phase and do not leak scope.
- Confirm formatting and alignment are preserved.

## Training

When the user requests "train", read the following sources:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/design/db/` (all files)
- `src/pypnm/lib/` (DB/persistence + config helpers)
- `src/pypnm/api/` (routing/service patterns, where applicable)
- `tools/agent-review/` (all files, if present)
