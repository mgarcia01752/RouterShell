### Summary
Added default install-time baseline snapshot capture for RouterShell. The installer now saves host and network state under /var/lib/routershell/baseline before install changes, skips existing baselines unless forced, supports snapshot-only and no-snapshot modes, and documents that uninstall does not restore network state.

## Linux Runtime Install

[README INSTALLATION](install/README.md)

RouterShell includes a generic installer for non-embedded Linux hosts such as
Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL-compatible systems, and openSUSE. Embedded and
BusyBox-style targets are intentionally out of scope for this installer.

Production install is the default.
The installer captures a root-only baseline snapshot under
`/var/lib/routershell/baseline` before making install changes.

Test installer changes in a disposable VM before running them on a development
workstation. Use `--development` only when testing editable installs with dev
dependencies; see [RouterShell VM Install Testing](tools/vm/README.md).

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh
routershell
```

## Run RouterShell From Source

```bash
./start.sh
```

## Python Development Install

RouterShell now includes Python packaging metadata in `pyproject.toml`.
For local development, use an isolated virtual environment and install the
project in editable mode:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

After installation, run the CLI entry point:

```bash
routershell
```

Factory reset is also exposed as a console entry point:

```bash
routershell-factory-reset
```

Build distribution artifacts with:

```bash
python -m build
```

Run validation with:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m ruff check .
```

## Git Helpers

Git helper scripts live under `tools/git/`:

```bash
./tools/git/git-save.sh --commit-msg "Update RouterShell"
./tools/git/git-push.sh --commit-msg "Update RouterShell"
```

See [RouterShell Git Helpers](tools/git/README.md) for save, push, and guarded branch
history reset workflows.

## Release Helpers

Release helper scripts live under `tools/release/`:

```bash
./tools/release/check_version.py
./tools/release/release.py --next patch --dry-run
```

See [RouterShell Release Helpers](tools/release/README.md) for version checks,
dry runs, releases, and commit reports.

## [TODO](todo.md)

# FILE: install/README.md
# RouterShell Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and uninstalling RouterShell on a general-purpose Linux system.
This install path is for non-embedded hosts such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL-compatible systems, and openSUSE.

BusyBox, Alpine, OpenWrt, Buildroot, Yocto images, and embedded/minimal router images are intentionally out of scope until those targets have a dedicated install design.

## Prerequisites

- You must have sudo privileges.
- The host must have internet access for operating-system packages and Python dependencies.
- The host must use `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, or `zypper`.

## Supported Package Managers

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get`
- Fedora/RHEL/CentOS compatible systems: `dnf` or `yum`
- openSUSE/SUSE: `zypper`

## Installation

Run the installer from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh
```

This is the production runtime install path. Development tools and VM testing
helpers are not installed by default.

The installer:

- Captures a host/network baseline snapshot under `/var/lib/routershell/baseline`.
- Installs required host packages for network management workflows.
- Creates a RouterShell runtime virtual environment under `/opt/routershell`.
- Installs RouterShell into that virtual environment.
- Adds `routershell` and `routershell-factory-reset` launchers under `/usr/local/bin`.
- Creates `/tmp/log` for RouterShell runtime logs.
- Warns if port 53 is already in use, but does not stop or remove existing services.

### Install Options

Capture a baseline snapshot and exit without installing RouterShell:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --snapshot-only
```

Replace an existing baseline snapshot:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --force-snapshot
```

Skip baseline capture:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --no-snapshot
```

Install in development mode:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --development
```

Development mode installs RouterShell editable with the Python `.[dev]`
dependencies from `pyproject.toml`. Use this for VM-based installer testing or
developer validation, not production hosts.

Use a custom install root:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --install-root /opt/routershell
```

Use a custom launcher directory:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --bin-dir /usr/local/bin
```

Skip operating-system package installation:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --skip-os-packages
```

Skip RouterShell Python package installation:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --skip-python-package
```

After installation, run:

```bash
routershell
```

## Uninstall

Run the uninstaller from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./install/uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller removes RouterShell's runtime virtual environment and command launchers.
It does not remove shared operating-system packages such as Python, `iproute`, `dnsmasq`, `hostapd`, or `lshw`.
It also does not restore network state from the baseline snapshot.

Remove RouterShell runtime logs as well:

```bash
sudo ./install/uninstall.sh --remove-runtime-logs
```

Use matching custom paths if they were used during install:

```bash
sudo ./install/uninstall.sh --install-root /opt/routershell --bin-dir /usr/local/bin
```

## Notes

- The generic installer is intended for normal Linux distributions first.
- Production install is the default; development install requires `--development`.
- Baseline snapshot capture is enabled by default and is not overwritten unless `--force-snapshot` is used.
- Baseline snapshots are saved root-only under `/var/lib/routershell/baseline`.
- Restore is intentionally not part of uninstall; it should be a separate explicit workflow.
- Embedded and image-built environments should get separate install logic once their requirements are better understood.
- VM-based install testing should be used before running this installer on a development workstation.
- See [RouterShell VM Install Testing](../tools/vm/README.md) for the Multipass test workflow.

## Baseline Snapshot

The install-time baseline records current host and network state before
RouterShell makes install changes. This is intended for audit and future
restore tooling.

The snapshot includes:

- `/etc/os-release`, `/etc/hostname`, `/etc/hosts`, and `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- Hostname and kernel output.
- `ip address`, route, rule, and neighbor state when `ip` is available.
- Bridge link and VLAN state when `bridge` is available.
- `iptables-save`, `ip6tables-save`, and `nft list ruleset` when available.
- Network-related sysctl values when `sysctl` is available.
- Selected systemd service active/enabled states.
- Network configuration file metadata for common config directories.
- A `manifest.json` and `capture-status.log`.

Network configuration file contents are not copied to avoid capturing secrets
such as WiFi credentials. The snapshot is not restored automatically during
uninstall.

# RouterShell VM Install Testing

This directory contains a Multipass-based workflow for testing the generic
RouterShell Linux installer away from the development workstation.

This is a development workflow. It is not part of the production RouterShell
install process.

The VM workflow is for general-purpose Linux install testing only. BusyBox,
OpenWrt, Buildroot, Yocto/Poky images, and embedded router targets remain out
of scope until they have a dedicated install design.

## Prerequisites

- Multipass installed on the development workstation.
- Network access from the VM for OS packages and Python dependencies.

## Default VM

- Name: `routershell-install-test`
- Image: Ubuntu `24.04`
- CPUs: `2`
- Memory: `2G`
- Disk: `12G`

Override defaults with environment variables:

```bash
RS_VM_NAME=routershell-ubuntu-2404 RS_VM_IMAGE=24.04 tools/vm/multipass-create.sh
```

## Workflow

Create the VM:

```bash
tools/vm/multipass-create.sh
```

Run the production install test:

```bash
tools/vm/multipass-test-install.sh
```

By default, the VM test runs:

```bash
sudo /tmp/RouterShell/install/install.sh
```

That production install captures a baseline snapshot in the VM under
`/var/lib/routershell/baseline`.

Use `--development` to test editable install mode with development dependencies:

```bash
tools/vm/multipass-test-install.sh --development
```

Open a shell inside the VM:

```bash
tools/vm/multipass-shell.sh
```

Delete the VM:

```bash
tools/vm/multipass-destroy.sh --purge
```

## What The Test Does

`multipass-test-install.sh` creates a tar archive of the current worktree,
excluding `.git`, `.venv`, caches, and build outputs. It transfers the archive
into the VM, extracts it under `/tmp/RouterShell`, runs the generic installer
in production mode by default, and verifies:

- `/usr/local/bin/routershell` exists and is executable.
- `/usr/local/bin/routershell-factory-reset` exists and is executable.
- `/opt/routershell/venv/bin/python` exists and is executable.
- `/var/lib/routershell/baseline/manifest.json` exists.
- The installed Python environment can import `routershell` and
  `routershell_version`.

The test intentionally does not start the interactive RouterShell CLI.

Copy the current RouterShell worktree into the Multipass VM and test install it.

Usage:
  multipass-test-install.sh [--development] [--skip-os-packages]

Environment:
  RS_VM_NAME       VM name. Default: routershell-install-test
  RS_VM_REPO_DIR   Path inside VM. Default: /tmp/RouterShell

By default, the VM test runs the production runtime install path. Use
--development to test editable install mode with development dependencies.
