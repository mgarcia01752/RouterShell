# RouterShell Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and uninstalling RouterShell on a general-purpose Linux system.
This install path is for non-embedded hosts such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL-compatible systems, and openSUSE.

BusyBox, Alpine, OpenWrt, Buildroot, Yocto images, and embedded/minimal router images are intentionally out of scope until those targets have a dedicated install design.

## Prerequisites

- You must have sudo privileges.
- The host must have internet access for operating-system packages and Python dependencies.
- The host must use `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, or `zypper`.

## Supported Package Managers

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get`
- Fedora/RHEL/CentOS compatible systems: `dnf` or `yum`
- openSUSE/SUSE: `zypper`

## Installation

Run the installer from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh
```

The installer:

- Installs required host packages for network management workflows.
- Creates a RouterShell runtime virtual environment under `/opt/routershell`.
- Installs RouterShell into that virtual environment.
- Adds `routershell` and `routershell-factory-reset` launchers under `/usr/local/bin`.
- Creates `/tmp/log` for RouterShell runtime logs.
- Warns if port 53 is already in use, but does not stop or remove existing services.

### Install Options

Use a custom install root:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --install-root /opt/routershell
```

Use a custom launcher directory:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --bin-dir /usr/local/bin
```

Skip operating-system package installation:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --skip-os-packages
```

Skip RouterShell Python package installation:

```bash
sudo ./install/install.sh --skip-python-package
```

After installation, run:

```bash
routershell
```

## Uninstall

Run the uninstaller from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./install/uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller removes RouterShell's runtime virtual environment and command launchers.
It does not remove shared operating-system packages such as Python, `iproute`, `dnsmasq`, `hostapd`, or `lshw`.

Remove RouterShell runtime logs as well:

```bash
sudo ./install/uninstall.sh --remove-runtime-logs
```

Use matching custom paths if they were used during install:

```bash
sudo ./install/uninstall.sh --install-root /opt/routershell --bin-dir /usr/local/bin
```

## Notes

- The generic installer is intended for normal Linux distributions first.
- Embedded and image-built environments should get separate install logic once their requirements are better understood.
- VM-based install testing should be used before running this installer on a development workstation.
